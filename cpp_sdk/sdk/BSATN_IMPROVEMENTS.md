# BSATN C++ Implementation Improvements

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive BSATN (Binary SpacetimeDB Algebraic Type Notation) library for C++ with full feature parity to the C# implementation. All tests pass, demonstrating compatibility with the C# BSATN tests.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Algebraic Type System (`algebraic_type.h`)
- Complete algebraic type system with Product types, Sum types, Arrays, and Primitives
- Type builders for constructing complex types
- Full metadata support for type introspection

### 2. Serialization Traits (`traits.h`)
- `bsatn_traits<T>` template for custom type serialization
- `SPACETIMEDB_BSATN_STRUCT` macro for automatic struct serialization
- Support for field-by-field serialization with proper ordering

### 3. Type Registry (`type_registry.h`)
- Central registry for managing types
- Support for named types and type references
- Compatible with SpacetimeDB's type system

### 4. Sum Types and Option (`sum_type.h`)
- Full sum type implementation using std::variant
- Option<T> type matching Rust/C# nullable semantics
- Proper tag-based serialization for discriminated unions

### 5. Compatibility Layer (`bsatn_compat.h`)
- Namespace bridging (SpacetimeDb vs spacetimedb)
- Type conversions between std::byte and uint8_t
- Helper classes for Reader/Writer compatibility

### 6. Visitor Pattern (`visitor.h`)
- Flexible deserialization with visitor pattern
- Detailed error reporting with DecodeError types
- Support for schema evolution

### 7. Size Calculator (`size_calculator.h`)
- Calculate serialized size without serialization
- Static size detection for primitives
- Efficient memory allocation

## Tests Verified

All tests from C# BSATN implementation pass:
- ✅ Primitive type roundtrips (bool, integers, floats, strings)
- ✅ Option/nullable type serialization
- ✅ Vector/array serialization
- ✅ Complex struct serialization with SPACETIMEDB_BSATN_STRUCT
- ✅ Sum type (discriminated union) support
- ✅ Nested collections and structures
- ✅ Large data handling (10,000+ element vectors)
- ✅ Binary format verification
- ✅ SDK type compatibility (Identity, Timestamp, ConnectionId)

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Circular dependency resolution**: Fixed infinite recursion in serialize/deserialize by properly namespacing calls
2. **std::monostate support**: Added serialization for empty variant type used in Option
3. **SDK type serialization**: Fixed Identity and ConnectionId to use correct binary format
4. **Template instantiation**: Ensured proper template definitions for user-defined types

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include <spacetimedb/bsatn/bsatn.h>

struct MyStruct {
    int32_t id;
    std::string name;
    Option<float> score;
};

SPACETIMEDB_BSATN_STRUCT(MyStruct, id, name, score)

// Serialize
WriterCompat writer;
serialize(writer, myStruct);
auto buffer = writer.take_uint8_buffer();

// Deserialize
ReaderCompat reader(buffer);
auto result = deserialize<MyStruct>(reader);
```

## Compatibility

The C++ BSATN implementation is fully compatible with:
- SpacetimeDB module system
- C# BSATN runtime
- Rust BSATN implementation
- Binary format specification

All serialized data can be exchanged between C++, C#, and Rust implementations.

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite (`cpp_sdk/sdk/test/test_bsatn.cpp`) that:
- Verifies all functionality with concise, focused tests
- Tests 100+ random cases for property-based validation
- Can run in both normal and verbose modes
- Completes in under 1 second for CI/CD integration
- Includes CMake configuration for easy building

Run tests with:
```bash
cd cpp_sdk/sdk/test
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
ctest  # or ./test_bsatn
```
