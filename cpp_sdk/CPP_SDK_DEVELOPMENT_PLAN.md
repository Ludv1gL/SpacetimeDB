## Achieving Feature Parity with C# Bindings

**Generated**: January 2025  
**Goal**: Bring C++ SDK to feature parity with the mature C# bindings  
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Current State Analysis

### C++ SDK Status
- ‚úÖ Basic table operations (insert, basic queries)
- ‚úÖ BSATN serialization (uint8_t-based, consistent)
- ‚úÖ Reducer definitions via macros
- ‚úÖ X-macro pattern for table declarations
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging system with multi-level support and caller info
- ‚úÖ Performance measurement with LogStopwatch
- ‚ùå Limited error handling (basic error codes only)
- ‚ùå No index management
- ‚ùå No advanced query capabilities
- ‚ùå No code generation system
- ‚ùå Limited type system support

### C# Bindings Capabilities (Reference Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Rich logging system with performance measurement
- ‚úÖ Complete algebraic type system with auto-serialization
- ‚úÖ Advanced table operations (update, delete-by-filter, count)
- ‚úÖ Index management (B-tree, unique constraints)
- ‚úÖ Range-based and filtered querying
- ‚úÖ Roslyn-based code generation
- ‚úÖ Schema management with column attributes
- ‚úÖ Rich context information (sender, connection, timestamp, RNG)
