## CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED (June 4, 2025)

### Testing revealed fundamental problems with the C++ SDK:

1. **Header Architecture Broken**
   - Multiple conflicting definitions of core types
   - Circular dependencies between headers
   - spacetimedb.h includes cause compilation failures

2. **FFI Layer Incomplete**
   - Most FFI functions declared but not implemented
   - Missing critical functions for table operations
   - No actual connection to SpacetimeDB runtime

3. **Infrastructure vs Reality Gap**
   - Created extensive headers with no working implementation
   - Features appear complete but don't actually function
   - Only minimal_sdk.h approach partially works

### Recommended Fix Priority:
1. Fix header architecture - eliminate conflicts
2. Implement missing FFI functions
3. Create proper integration layer
4. Test each feature individually before claiming completion

## Current Development Session

**Work Attempted Today (June 4, 2025)**:
1. ⚠️ Table operations - Headers created but FFI missing
2. ⚠️ Built-in reducers - Headers created but conflicts prevent usage
3. ⚠️ ReducerContext enhancements - Headers created but not integrated
4. ⚠️ Advanced features - Headers created but cause compilation failures
5. ⚠️ Schedule reducer functionality - Types created but not working
6. ⚠️ Credential management - Infrastructure created but not functional

10. ✅ Testing revealed critical architectural issues

**Current Status**: SDK is fundamentally broken. Actual progress: 15% (was 45%, now less due to discovered issues)  
**Started**: January 2025  
**Last Updated**: June 4, 2025  
**Status**: Critical refactoring needed before any progress can continue

**Today's Discoveries**:
1. ⚠️ Created extensive header infrastructure without working implementations
2. ⚠️ Discovered fundamental header architecture conflicts
3. ⚠️ Found that most FFI functions are missing implementations
4. ⚠️ Realized only minimal_sdk.h approach partially works
5. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite that revealed these issues
6. ✅ Documented all problems in detail
7. ✅ Created refactoring plan to fix issues
8. ✅ Provided honest assessment of SDK state

**Previous Feature 6 Accomplishments**:

2. ✅ Created constraint management with RawConstraintDefV9 structure
3. ✅ Built sequence support for auto-increment with configurable parameters
4. ✅ Added scheduled table infrastructure with RawScheduleDefV9

### Overall C++ SDK Progress: ~15% Complete (Actual Working Features)

**Note**: Previous progress estimates were based on infrastructure created but not integrated. Testing reveals most features are not actually working due to header conflicts and missing FFI implementations.

**Module SDK Core Features** (3/22 actually working):
- ✅ Table registration and basic operations (insert, count)
- ✅ Reducer registration with argument deserialization
- ✅ BSATN serialization with automatic field registration
- ✅ Module exports (__describe_module__, __call_reducer__)
- ❌ Multi-level logging system (header conflicts)
- ❌ Exception hierarchy (not integrated)
- ❌ Type system with algebraic types (not integrated)
- ❌ Field registration macros (partially working)
- ⚠️ Working module examples (only minimal SDK works)
- ❌ Autogenerated type definitions (not integrated)
- ❌ Table iteration/scanning (FFI missing)
- ❌ Delete operations (FFI missing)
- ❌ Update operations (FFI missing)
- ❌ Built-in reducers (header conflicts)
- ❌ ReducerContext metadata (header conflicts)
- ❌ RNG integration (not integrated)
- ❌ Advanced features integration (header conflicts)
- ❌ Schedule reducer functionality (not integrated)
- ❌ Credential management (not integrated)
- ❌ Constraint validation (not integrated)
- ❌ Transaction control (not integrated)
- ❌ Module versioning

**Immediate Next Steps (Critical)**:
1. Fix header architecture to eliminate conflicts
2. Implement missing FFI functions for basic operations
3. Create proper integration layer between components
4. Test each feature individually before integration
5. Rebuild SDK incrementally with working features only

**Only After Foundation is Fixed**:
1. Integrate the extensive infrastructure created today
2. Add remaining missing features
3. Consider Phase 3 features (Code Generation, Enhanced Developer Experience)
