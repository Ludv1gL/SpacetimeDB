# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SpacetimeDB is a revolutionary database that merges database and application server functionality into one system. Instead of the traditional architecture (database → app server → clients), SpacetimeDB lets you write your entire backend as "modules" that run **inside** the database. Clients connect directly to the database via WebSocket for real-time updates.

### What Makes SpacetimeDB Unique

- **Module-Based Architecture**: Application logic is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and runs inside the database
- **Memory-First Design**: All active data is held in memory for microsecond latency with Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) persistence
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Built-in subscription system automatically syncs changes to connected clients
- **Direct Client Connections**: Clients connect directly to the database via WebSocket, no intermediate servers needed
- **Tagline**: "Multiplayer at the speed of light" - optimized for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools

## Development Memories and Guidelines

- The files in `internal/autogen` for C++ should be generated from `/crates/codegen/examples/regen-cpp-moduledef.rs`, and should not be edited directly. Any edits will need to be edits of the codegen file, also any file ending with g.cpp or g.cs etc can be assumed should be autogenerated from somewhere else
- Publishing should be done using the command "spacetime publish" to access the local server, you should do this instead of running crates
