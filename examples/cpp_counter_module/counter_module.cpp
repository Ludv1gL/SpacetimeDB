    // So, if it was deleted, we just insert with the increment_by value as the new value.
    // If it wasn't found, this also correctly sets the initial value.
    // A real increment would need to read the old value.
    // Let's assume for this simplified example, increment_by is the new value if it didn't exist,
    // or if it did, we're effectively setting its value (not strictly incrementing an unknown old value).
    // To make it a true increment, we'd need a static map or similar for this example if no host read.
    // For now, let's just set the value to `increment_by` for simplicity of demonstration of write operations.

    Counter new_counter_state = {counter_name, increment_by};
    // A more realistic approach if this was a "set" rather than "increment":
    // Counter new_counter_state = {counter_name, increment_by};
    // If it's truly an increment on a potentially existing value, this example is simplified.
    // Let's make the reducer set the value to `increment_by`, and if we want to show increment,
    // we'd need a get operation or a static variable for this example.

    // To show a true increment, let's assume a scenario where the client sends the *current* value
    // it knows about, and the reducer uses that as a base if the counter doesn't exist.
    // This is not ideal but works for a simple example without reads.
    // A better example reducer would be "SetCounterValue".
    // Let's change the reducer to "SetCounterValue" for clarity.

    // (Then update registration and call)

    // Sticking to "IncrementCounter" but with simplified logic:
